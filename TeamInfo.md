## Project Summary

The basic premise of our project is that this is an application that allows people to publicly advertise their house parties. Users on this application can either create a party or sign up to attend a party.  This creates two different modes of interaction: viewing parties and creating parties. On the viewing side, they will show the user a list of parties that they can sign up for. Each party post will show the specific details of the party, such as location, time, and RSVP form. On the party creation side: the user can fill out a form with the details of their party, such as location, time, capacity, etc.

We will have a two-part, 5-star rating system. This system will show users the enjoyability of the party they attended as well as the safety of the party. On the safety side of things, we are going to allow users to go back on our platform and leave a rating on the party. This will allow users to know the safety of that party and any future parties they throw. This logic works the same way with the enjoyability aspect as well.
